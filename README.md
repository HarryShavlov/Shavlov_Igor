## I was educated in the Pedagogical Education program (Physics and Computer Science).
## I thought about getting an education in the field of artificial intelligence, but at some point I realized that this is not what I would like to connect my life with.
## 1st year student of the Master's degree in game programming. I can program in the following languages: Java, Kotlin, Python, C# and a little C++. The first programming language I learned was Java.

### Now I would like to gain knowledge in the development of mobile applications and/or website layout.

Today, I teach children the basic principles of programming in languages:
- Java
- Python
- Kotlin
- Pascal
  
I think that high school students should be able to work at a basic level with Git.

I tried to teach Lazarus and Delphi to children, 
but at some point I realized that it was better 
to show the visual component of the project assembly 
in more applied programming languages, 
since Lazarus and Delphi work with Pascal

I would like to improve my knowledge of Olympiad programming in order to give students the opportunity to speak at Olympiads and show good results. 
Now I think that I do not have enough knowledge in Olympiad programming, which partly led me to this specialty.
